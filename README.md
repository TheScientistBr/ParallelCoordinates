## ELECTRONIC CATALOGS BASED ON PARALLEL COORDINATES

This dissertation introduces and empirically validates a new proposal in Electronic 
Catalogs, based on Visual One Page Catalog (VOPC) [LLW 2003][L&W 2004]. The Theory 
of Parallel Coordinates is the main theoretical basis for this study. The proposed interface to 
Electronic Catalogs based on Parallel Coordinates presents, besides filtered products on a 
single page, multiple attributes in only two dimensions. Among the extensions of original 
VOPC, it should be highlighted the use of fading and distances between attributes 
proportional to their relative importance degrees.  To evaluate the efficiency of this new 
electronic catalog, two interfaces have been implemented: traditional (reference for 
comparison, usually found at portals in the Internet) and Parallel Coordinates. The principal 
objective of this study is to contribute with the improving of Electronic Catalogs in order to 
ease product search and choice. Specifically, efficiency (measured by the temporal duration of 
the search and choice process) and effort (measuredby the number of clicks of the mouse) are 
compared in these two experimental conditions. As result of the (descriptive and inferential) 
statistical analysis and data interpretation, the equivalence between traditional and Parallel 
Coordinates was obtained, even being the last one less familiar. Hypothetically, as the 
proposed system becomes more familiar, favorable significant differences could happen in 
future experiments. 

**Key words**: Electronic Catalogs, Parallel Coordinates, Internet.
